# MLCLAS
MLCLAS is a Python module for multi-label classification built on Scipy.

The project is built during my graduation project for bachelor's degree.

## Dependencies
MLCLAS is tested to work under Python 3.5, and on the systems of OS X and Linux.

It is promised to work as intended with these pakages:

- NumPy >= 1.10

- SciPy >= 0.17.0

- scikit-learn >= 0.17.0

- cvxpy >= 0.4.0

Lower version of dependencies may cause unexpected problems, so it is strongly recommended to update these packages.

## Documentation
The functions provided by this library is quite concise. You may view the examples in the `examples` folder for reference.

If you are reading this from Pypi, please visit github page to download the `examples` folder.
